A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this tap is available by running:

```

### Settings for Specific Streams

Settings can be added on a per-stream basis and can be set using the stream_config setting. The stream_config setting takes a dictionary with the stream name as the key and supports the following configuration options:

| Setting             | Required | Default | Description |
|:--------------------|:--------:|:-------:|:------------|
| parameters          | False    | None    | URL query string to send to the stream endpoint |

Example:

```json
{
    "stream_config": {
        "users": {
            "parameters": "?status=active"
        }
    }
}
```

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Source Authentication and Authorization

<!--
Developer TODO: If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.
-->

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-zoom` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-zoom --version
tap-zoom --help
tap-zoom --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_zoom/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-zoom` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-zoom --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-zoom
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-zoom --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-zoom target-jsonl
```
